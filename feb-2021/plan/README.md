* Before Simla wear your warm liners
* Try to avoid a pillion on this ride
* Carry only the most essential items
* Always give way to climbing vehicles 
* Control your ego while riding in groups
* Carry ample cash, while riding in hills
* Tighten your spare fuel can with carrier
* Avoid accelerating with half clutch for long
* Take small pauses every 1-2 hours to cool down
* Honk on every turn and never drive in wrong lane
* Fog light at fronts and reflecting tapes at the back
* Stay friendly with everyone, you encounter while riding
* Early start at around 9 AM. Avoid riding beyond 5:30 PM
* In high altitude regions, avoid staying long or sleeping
* Remember the cold starting your motorcycle every morning 
* Water and food are the key to health, drink and eat wisely
* Never skip any police checkpoint, always register with them
* Switch off your lights to let climbing vehicles see clearly
* Fill up your tanks every night, to avoid any delay in morning
* Do not ride in the outer most lane, its where the animal roams
* Avoid making pre-bookings; planning doesnâ€™t works mostly on this trip
* In case of any medical emergency, contact the local government dispensary
* Keep all necessary documents at an easily traceable place e.g. tank bag etc
* Water streams (nala) are easier to cross in morning, owing to less water flow
* Don't stay long at any high altitude point. Mountain sickness can kill your joy
* Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS) symptoms are headache, dizziness, fever or vomiting  
* Avoid following any vehicle for long, try to overtake and avoid any pothole/obstacle
* In high altitude regions, apply oil on the belly button, to keep your lips moisturized
* Avoid full tank, keep little bit of air in it. Also keep opening your spare/jerry fuel can
